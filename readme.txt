I am a scholar with a Bachelor's Degree in Pedagogy turned future web developer. Right now I'm learning how to code, both front end and back end, and I'm loving it! 
I also plan on learning web design and UI/UX. When I was a teenager I was a blogger and was always interested in the coding part of making your own blog. I always helped my friends to make headers for their blogs and with the coding part.
In my spare time I enjoy consuming media - movies, TV-series and documentaries.  Now I can add coding to my list of hobbies!
